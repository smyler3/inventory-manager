- Make Delete product form
- Add delete product form validation
- Connect delete product form to database

- Make edit product form
- Add edit product form validation
- Connect edit product form to database

- Implement warnings for low and critical stock level

- Add validator for not-unique titles

- Add form errors above relevant field
