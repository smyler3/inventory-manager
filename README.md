TODO:

- Make Delete product form
- Connect delete product form to database

- Make edit product form
- Connect edit product form to database

- I think checking data, then fetching feels dumb, maybe combine

- Decide sort button options for categories and products
- Make search fields work

- Implement warnings for low and critical stock level

- Add form errors above relevant field

- Remove console.error logs e.g.console.error("Error editing category:", error); for production
